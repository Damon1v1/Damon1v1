## About me
* Web developer from a food service background consolidating leadership, teamwork skills, and quick problem solving ability from a fast-paced work environment to build a sleek and intuitive user experience on the web. Helped my restaurant achieve the fastest service times company wide in the third fiscal quarter of 2020 and number one overall restaurant in quarter four. I enjoy working in an environment where I can count on my co-workers and they can count on me to solve real-world problems. Education and certifications in full-stack development and computer information systems from University of California Irvine and Lewis & Clark Technical School.

* Currently working on [Simulview](https://github.com/Damon1v1/Simulview) with my peers. The goal of the application is to create a service that lets users enjoy videos together for synchronous playback for multiple connected sessions; also, a new [Portfolio](https://github.com/Damon1v1/react-portfolio) in the React framework.
